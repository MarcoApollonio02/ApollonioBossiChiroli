\par In today's rapidly evolving job market, there is a growing concern regarding the skill mismatch between fresh
graduates and the requirements of employers. This issue is particularly prevalent in the realm of internships,
especially in the STEM field, where students are often not able to meet the demands of industry-relevant roles, while
companies struggle to find candidates with the necessary skills for their internship programs.

\par This skill mismatch not only harms the career development of students but also affects the productivity of the
companies themselves. On one hand, students miss out on valuable learning opportunities and real-world experiences. On
the other hand, companies experience inefficiencies due to the time and resources spent on training interns who lack
the essential skills required for their roles.

\par To address this issue, we wish to establish a platform that connects students with relevant internship
opportunities while simultaneously providing employers with a pool of qualified candidates. S\&C also aims to empower
universities to take a proactive role in resolving potential issues that may arise between students and companies, thus
creating a safe space for both parties.

\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}%

\par This document serves mainly as a comprehensive reference for the development team involved in implementing
Students\&Companies.

\par This material also aims to provide an authoritative overview of the software's capabilities and constraints,
ensuring clear understanding among all stakeholders: students, companies, and university personnel.

\section{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}%

\par S\&C is a platform that matches students seeking internships with companies offering these opportunities. The
platform manages internship postings and student applications, while allowing companies to evaluate candidates through
customized questionnaires. Throughout the internship, both parties can provide feedback on its progress, with
universities mediating any disputes that arise.

\par The platform employs recommendation algorithms to suggest relevant internship opportunities to students based on
their skills, while helping companies discover potential candidates that match their requirements.
